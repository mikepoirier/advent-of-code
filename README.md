# Advent of Code

Welcome to my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) project! I created it so that I can share my AOC solutions with others. If you would like to join, feel free to open a PR with your solution!

Here is the high-level project structure:

```
.
├── <username>
│  └── <year>
│     └── <language>
│        └── <solution>
└── README.md
```
